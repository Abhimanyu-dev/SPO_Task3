# SPO Web Exec Task 3 Login and Sign Up page with encryption

Follow the instruction to get started

``` bash
git clone https://github.com/Abhimanyu-dev/SPO_Task3.git
cd SPO_Task3
cd backend 
npm i
npm run dev
```
This code will first clone the repository into your local machine and then start the backend server.
To start the frontend go back to the SPO_Task3 directory in a new terminal window and paste the following commands:
```bash
cd frontend
npm i 
npm run dev
```
Backend server will listen on port 8080 and the frontend server will most likely listen on port 3000 if it is available.
